# NBA-Score-Predictor
# Project Overview
This project takes on the challenge of forecasting which team will win in NBA matchups. It leverages a variety of data science techniques, starting with web scraping to collect NBA box scores, followed by rigorous data cleaning and transformation using BeautifulSoup and pandas. Once we have structured the data into clean DataFrames, we apply feature selection methods to pinpoint the most influential factors in game outcomes. The insights gained from this process are then used to train a predictive machine learning model. To enhance the model's performance, we also calculate rolling predictors that consider recent team performance trends.

# Steps Involved
Web Scraping: Automated collection of NBA standings and box score data. 

Data Cleaning: Utilizing BeautifulSoup to clean up the HTML data.

Data Parsing: Converting box scores into pandas DataFrames for easier analysis.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most predictive features for game outcomes.

Model Training: Developing and training the machine learning model to predict game winners.

Performance Improvement: Implementing rolling predictors to refine the model's accuracy.

The project aims to be a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in sports analytics or looking to apply machine learning to real-world datasets.
